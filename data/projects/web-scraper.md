## Overview

Developed a web scraper to determine if a small business website belongs to a marketing agency. This proof-of-concept tool aimed to address the challenge advertising platforms face in distinguishing between marketing agencies and regular businesses.

## Problem

Advertising platforms often struggle to accurately identify small marketing agencies among various types of businesses, impacting targeted advertising efforts.

## Solution

Created a web scraper that searches small business websites for specific keywords indicative of marketing agencies. This tool uses keywords to identify relevant businesses and refines its model based on testing results.

## Challenges

- Defining a comprehensive set of keywords to accurately identify marketing agencies
- Ensuring the web scraper effectively navigates and extracts relevant information from diverse website structures
- Testing and refining the model to improve accuracy and reduce false positives

## Results and Impact

Successfully developed and tested a web scraper for identifying marketing agencies:

- **Improved accuracy** in distinguishing marketing agencies from other businesses using keyword analysis
- Laid the groundwork for future development using AI models for more advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities
- Validated proof-of-concept approach for automated business classification

## Reflection

This project demonstrated the potential of web scraping for business identification but also highlighted the limitations of keyword-based approaches. In the future, I plan to incorporate AI models for NLP to enhance the accuracy and scalability of the tool.
