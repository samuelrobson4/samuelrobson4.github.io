My personal portfolio website featuring a clean design and responsive layout to showcase my research and projects. Built with modern web technologies and optimized for performance.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: Seamlessly adapts to all screen sizes from mobile to desktop
- **Interactive Elements**: Engaging animations and transitions for better user experience
- **Project Showcase**: Dynamic project cards with physics-based interactions
- **Blog Integration**: Automatically fetches and displays latest blog posts from Substack

## Technical Details

The project leverages modern development practices including continuous integration, automated testing, and progressive enhancement to deliver a robust and reliable user experience across multiple platforms and devices.

Built with a focus on performance, the site achieves excellent Lighthouse scores through:
- Optimized asset loading
- Lazy loading of images
- Efficient bundling with esbuild
- Server-side rendering where applicable

## Challenges & Solutions

Through strategic planning and agile development methodologies, we achieved significant improvements in system performance while reducing operational complexity and maintenance overhead.

The main challenge was creating a physics-based interaction system that felt natural and performant across all devices, which was solved using Matter.js and careful optimization of render loops.

## Results

- ⚡ 95+ Lighthouse performance score
- 📱 100% mobile responsive
- 🎨 Custom interactive components
- 🚀 Deployed on GitHub Pages
