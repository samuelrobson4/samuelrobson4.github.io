## Overview

Developed an application using generative AI tools and Next.js to help SMBs quickly generate advertising scripts, reducing the time spent on ad creation by ~50-70%. The project served as a proof of concept to explore the potential of generative AI in streamlining content creation.

## Problem

Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) spend a significant amount of time on the ad creation process, particularly in writing scripts for advertisements and content.

## Solution

Created an app leveraging generative AI to automate the generation of advertising scripts, to reduce the time and effort required by SMBs. The tool allowed users to input key details about their product or service, and the AI would generate tailored ad scripts.

## Challenges

- Exploring and integrating generative AI technologies in their early stages
- Ensuring the AI-generated scripts were high-quality and relevant
- Managing the limitations of a proof of concept, including scalability and user interface design

## Results

- **50-70% reduction** in time spent on ad script creation
- Proof of concept validating generative AI applications in SMB workflows
- Foundation for future scalability and feature expansion
