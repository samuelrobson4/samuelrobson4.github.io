## inspiration
Spotipod started from wanting a more **focused, tactile music experience**. Listening to albums at my dad’s stereo made me realize Spotify felt cluttered with playlists, recommendations, and podcasts. I wanted a simple, customizable interface that let me queue and play albums without distractions—something like an iPod for the streaming era.

## what i built
I designed a **clean, album-focused interface** that is minimalist but customizable. The backend uses **Google Sheets** for playlist and track management, while **Spotify’s Web API** handles live playback. On the frontend, the project is structured into modular components, built with **TypeScript, CSS, and JavaScript**, and optimized for mobile devices.

## challenges & solutions
- Making the UI feel **nostalgic, simple, and customizable**: designed modular components that adapt to different album displays and touch gestures.  
- Ensuring **real-time sync between Google Sheets and Spotify**: implemented debounced API calls and structured validation to maintain consistent playback.  
- Structuring the codebase for **clarity and scalability**: separated frontend and backend logic, enabling modularity and faster iteration.  
- Deploying and iterating rapidly: hosted on **Vercel** for instant updates with minimal friction.

Spotipod is a **mobile-first, album-focused controller** that balances simplicity, nostalgia, and real-time functionality. The project reinforced my approach to product design: combine **clear UX, practical technical architecture, and flexible customization**, skills I bring to both PM and hands-on product work.
