## Overview

Shipped ML-based data tagging tool to enforce GDPR requirements in GCP, achieving 90% accuracy and 80% efficiency gain. Collaborated with diverse stakeholders from legal, engineering, and marketing teams, presenting outcomes to the Chief Data Officer.

## Problem

Ensuring GDPR compliance across large-scale data infrastructure required manual data tagging and classification, which was time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale as data volumes grew.

## Solution

Developed and deployed a machine learning-based data tagging tool that automatically classifies and tags data according to GDPR requirements:

- Built ML models to identify and categorize sensitive data types
- Integrated the solution within Google Cloud Platform infrastructure
- Implemented automated tagging workflows to ensure compliance
- Created validation mechanisms to maintain accuracy standards

## Collaboration & Stakeholder Management

Successfully coordinated across multiple teams:

- Legal: Ensured compliance with GDPR regulations and data protection requirements
- Engineering: Integrated ML solution into existing data infrastructure
- Marketing: Aligned on data usage requirements and business needs
- Executive Leadership: Presented outcomes and strategic recommendations to CDO

## Results

- **90% accuracy** in automated data classification and tagging
- **80% efficiency gain** compared to manual tagging processes
- Successfully enforced GDPR compliance at scale across GCP infrastructure
- Presented prototype and outcomes to Chief Data Officer with positive reception

## Impact

This project demonstrated the feasibility of using machine learning to automate compliance processes, setting the foundation for scalable data governance across the organization.
